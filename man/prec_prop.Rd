\title{Sample size or precision for a proportion}
\usage{
prec_prop(p, n = NULL, conf.width = NULL, conf.level = 0.95,
  method = c("wilson", "agresti-coull", "exact", "wald"),
  tol = .Machine$double.eps^0.25)
}
\arguments{
\item{p}{proportion}

\item{n}{number of observations}

\item{conf.width}{precision (the full width of the conficende interval)}

\item{conf.level}{confidence level}

\item{method}{The method to use to calculate precision. Exactly one method
may be provided. Methods can be abbreviated.}

\item{tol}{numerical tolerance used in root finding, the default providing
(at least) four significant digits}
}
\value{
Object of class "presize", a list of arguments (including the
  computed one) augmented with method and note elements. In the wilson and
  agresti-coull formula, the p from wich the confidence interval is
  calculated is adjusted by a term (i.e. \eqn{p + term \pm ci}). This
  adjusted p is returned in \code{padj}.
}
\description{
\code{prec_prop} returns the sample size or the precision for the provided
proportion
}
\details{
Exactly one of the parameters \code{n, conf.width} must be passed as NULL,
and that parameter is determined from the other.

The wilson, agresti-coull, exact, and wald method are implemented. The
wilson method is suggested for small n (< 40), and the agresti-coull method
is suggested for larger n (see reference). The wald method is not suggested,
but provided due to its widespread use.

\code{\link[stats]{uniroot}} is used to solve n for the agresti-coull,
wilson, and exact method. Agresti-coull can be abbreviated by ac.
