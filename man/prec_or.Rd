\title{Sample size or precision for an odds ratio}
\usage{
prec_or(p1, p2, n1 = NULL, r = 1, conf.width = NULL, conf.level = 0.95,
  method = c("gart", "woolf", "indip_smooth"),
  tol = .Machine$double.eps^0.25)
}
\arguments{
\item{p1}{Risk among unexposed}

\item{p2}{Risk among exposed}

\item{n1}{Number of patients in unexposed group}

\item{r}{allocation ratio (relative size of unexposed and exposed cohort
(\code{n1} / \code{n2}))}

\item{conf.width}{precision (the full width of the conficende interval)}

\item{conf.level}{confidence level}

\item{method}{Exactly one of \code{indip_smooth} (\emph{default}),
\code{gart}, or \code{wolf}. Methods can be abbreviated.}

\item{tol}{numerical tolerance used in root finding, the default providing
(at least) four significant digits}
}
\value{
Object of class "presize", a list of arguments (including the
  computed one) augmented with method and note elements.
}
\description{
\code{prec_or} returns the sample size or the precision for the
provided proportions
}
\details{
Exactly one of the parameters \code{n, conf.width} must be passed as NULL,
and that parameter is determined from the other.

Woolf (\code{woolf}), Gart (\code{gart}), and Independence-smoothed logit
(\code{indip_smooth}) belong to a general family of adjusted confidence
intervals, adding 0 (woolf) to each cell, 0.5 (gart) to each cell, or an
adjustment for each cell based on observed data (independence-smoothed). In
gart and indip_smooth, estimate of the CI is not possible if \eqn{p1 = 0}, in
which case the OR becomes 0, but the lower level of the CI is > 0. Further,
if \eqn{p1 = 1} and \eqn{p2 < 1}, or if \eqn{p1 > 0} and \eqn{p2 = 0}, the OR
becomes \eqn{\infty}, but the upper limit of the CI is finite. For the
approximate intervals, \code{gart} and \code{indip_smooth} are the
recommended intervals (Fagerland et al. 2011).

\code{\link[stats]{uniroot}} is used to solve n for the woolf, gart, and
indip_smooth method.
